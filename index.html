    <p>Hi! As of 1/1/2022 Pop Microphones is closed for business.</p>
    <p>For any warranty claims, help or if you would just like to say hi, please email me at popmicrophones@gmail.com</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>On a personal note, I would like to say a big thanks to all of our customers and supporters over the last 4 years, it has been a big, fun journey and we wouldn't have done it without all of you.</p>
    <p>We closed the business to move on to new and exciting projects. Whilst Pop Microphones was profitable and growing it didn't grow large enough, quickly enough to justify "going big" with our production.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Making things is hard. If you are a creator of things, be it physical or digital, I appreciate you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many thanks,&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Simon Dean (founder of Pop Microphones)</p>
